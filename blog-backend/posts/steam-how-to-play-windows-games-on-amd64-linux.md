# [Steam] How to play Windows Games on AMD64 Linux

## Linux Gaming Experience with Steam Proton
Steam Deck is renowned among portable game players, and it uses Steam OS. It is basically a x64 Linux distribution, with a focus of on Linux Game machines. Since Steam is compatible with Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, and many distributions, you can enjoy Triple-A games without significant performance degradation. AAA Games like Elden Ring, show equivalent performance when compared to Windows.
*Note: It's better to have enough Hardware. At least your computer needs over 8GB.*
I've tested proton hotfix with 8GB ARM laptop, and I could run Limbus Company.
But if you want to try high-end games on your machine, you'd better to get higher RAM.
At least, your machine need 16GB to run your game without performance degradation.

Now, let me explain how to install Windows game on AMD64 Linux.

### Enable Proton Compatibility Tool

Elden Ring runs smoothly on Linux.
Other games are well supported too.
If the game supports Windows, you can play it on Linux too.

### How much of Valve's Proton tool is open source?

I read a reddit Q&A, about Proton's openness.

This is mostly open source, you can find the source on GitHub.

### Conclusion

Proton is a great tool to lower down the barrier between gamers and open source enthuasiasts. 
Many developers gave up playing any games on Linux, however this can be a great solution. This is not a difficult solution for Geeks, and now you can play Steam games by some clicks.

If your favorite games are uploaded on Steam, you can consider migrating to Linux.
