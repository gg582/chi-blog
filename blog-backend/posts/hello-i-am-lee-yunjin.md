# Hello! I am Lee Yunjin.

## Overview  
I am interested in Linux Desktop, and sometimes Linux Gaming. I will introduce daily tips for using Linux.

### Linux

First time I've installed Linux, I installed it for **Retrogaming.**

When I was 13, I played Tekken 3, Tag Tournament, 1945 Strikers.
My computer's HW spec was not that good, so I needed lightweight Linux for gaming.

My first distro was Debian 8, with Gnome. For better gaming experience I moved to LXQt(although I use KDE now).


### Programming

Before 2018, I had no specific interests about programming.
The codes I could write were, bash, ini configs.

However, a highschool Tech teacher Mr. Jung recommended programming club activity.
He taught me how to write Python, and my first application was PyGtk+ app.

During University, I learned Go language from Professor Jin.
He was a Go language enthusiast, and I followed his way and became Gopher.

Currently I am interested in Go Back-end development.


## Linux is better than macOS!

I was only 13 when I first installed Debian, however it was so convenient that I could use it better when compared to Windows 7/8.

FreeDesktop gave the best UI/UX for managing one's desktop without complex GUI configuration apps.

Rather, it is macOS for dumbs and geeks.

### KDE, Gnome, Cinnamone, Deepin ...

Don't spend your time configuring advanced options by CLI.
You can use these desktops and still can do every daily works.

### LXQt, Xfce4, Sway ...

Super-lightweight!
Blazing fast!

*But you have to understand CLI.*


### CLI only (popular stereotype)

Too geek. I can't imagine this. You should code everything you need instead of using GUI suites.



## People who needs Linux...

- Retro-computing Enthusiasts
- Kids, Elderly
- Developers
- Chromebook lovers(You are already a Linux user)
- macOS users(You will get used to it soon)
- BSD users(You are using X11/Wayland too!)


**You don't need any hacking/security knowledge.**

When I was a teenager, many other teenagers talked about cyber security focused Linux distributions. But, I always thought that **they are ruining a image of Linux Desktop.**.

It is really easy. Like Windows 11, it already gave unified and simple experience in late 2010s. 

If you know how to install Windows on your computer, you should try it.
