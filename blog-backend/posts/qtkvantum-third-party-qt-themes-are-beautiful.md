# [Qt][Kvantum] Third-party QT themes are beautiful

## Overview

Kvantum is a Qt theme manager for 3rd party look and feel.
However, it is hard to find custom themes unlike global themes.
KDE default extensions don't automatically scrape for Kvantum, as it is rather common theme manager for various kinds of Qt Desktop. However, KDE Store is a one of the biggest theme store for Linux or BSD Users.

## Search from Kvantum Categories

[KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/browse/)

You can browse many kinds of theme packs here.
Let's select Kvantum category from these resource types.

If you select and download the theme, it is often served as an archive file.
Extract the archive, and remember your desired theme directory.

### Tips

Common keywords like Material, Flat, Aero show enormous resources from the store.
